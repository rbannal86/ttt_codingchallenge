### Tic-Tac-Toe

Standard tic-tac-toe rules apply.
Before starting the game, each player enters their name.
The game then randomly assigns one player to go first.
The players choose a move and either confirms it or cancels it.
The game goes until one player wins, or all of the tiles have been selected and a tie is declared.
The players may then start a new game.

The number of games won by each player, and the number of ties, are documented on the scoreboard.

Players may reset the board, re-select players.
